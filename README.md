IBM5150
=======

An emulator of the IBM PC 5150, and its descendants and clones.

Todo
====

ISA DMA
=======

I don't quite understand how transfers are started, but then again, I haven't even started on this.

MDA
===

Only updates every frame. Might want to change that eventually.

CGA
===

Right now, it's just in there as a slightly modified MDA clone. Lots to be done.

8088
====

Only accurate on an opcode-level. No regards to actual execution times. This will have to wait until the 8086/8088 microcode is dumped.

80286
=====

VERY rudimentary. Not really needed right now anyway.

PIT
===

Not complete, but the basics are there.

PPI
===

Much to be done here.

PIC
===

It's sorta there, but still incomplete.
